# AI Choose Your Own Adventure API
Backend service built upon Cloudflare workers to power an AI Choose Your Own Adventure game using OpenAI and an on-premise easy diffusion instance.

## Easy Diffusion
I have a box setup at my house that runs an Easy Diffusion instance so I can utilize my RTX 3080 graphics card and not spend money on third party services.
It connects to Cloudlfare using their Zero Trust Tunnel service so I don't expose my home server to the internet.
